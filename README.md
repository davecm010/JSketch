This is a web development practice project designed to demonstrate how to implement a basic javascript script in conjunction with HTML and CSS. The output initially produces a 16x16 square grid. When each square is hovered over with a mouse pointer,  it turns and remains black, producing an etch-a-sketch like drawing. The grid's dimensions can be changed by hitting the reset button, wherein any value between 1 and 64 can be entered. The dimensions of the grid container remain the same, therefore a larger value entered (i.e. 64x64) produces smaller squares.
